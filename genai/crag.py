"""Corrective RAG (CRAG) helpers for the Augmentation chapter.

CRAG {cite}`yan2024crag` makes ordinary RAG robust to bad retrieval. Plain RAG trusts
whatever the retriever hands back and answers from it, so when the corpus does not
hold the answer the model confidently makes something up. CRAG adds a cheap step in
between: a RETRIEVAL EVALUATOR grades the retrieved chunks for how well they actually
match the question and routes to one of three corrective actions. (1) CORRECT, the
docs look relevant, so we REFINE them, keeping the on-topic strips and dropping any
filler, and answer locally. (2) INCORRECT, the docs miss the mark, so we DISCARD them
and FALL BACK TO A WEB SEARCH for fresh knowledge. (3) AMBIGUOUS, when the grade is in
between, so we hedge and do BOTH, combining the refined local docs with web results.
Then the model answers from the corrected knowledge instead of from whatever happened
to be nearest in the index.

Two honest simplifications from the paper. The paper trains a small T5 evaluator; we
reuse the chapter's own embeddings and score relevance by cosine similarity of the
question to its best retrieved chunk, which is deterministic and needs no extra model.
And the paper's decompose-recompose refinement is a small pipeline of its own; since
our chunks are already short, we approximate it by keeping the strips that are
individually on-topic. The routing, the web fallback, and the lesson are faithful.

The web fallback calls the live internet through the `ddgs` package (DuckDuckGo, no API
key), so it is slow, rate-limited, nondeterministic, and sends the query off the
machine. Every cell that calls the model or the web is frozen with a saved snapshot;
re-running hits the live web and the result will drift. CRAG_STUDY at the bottom is a
faithful record of what these functions do on gemma4:latest, reproduced by
scripts/_crag_probe.py.

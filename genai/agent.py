"""The agent built in the Agentic AI chapter.

Almost nothing in that chapter is implemented in the notebook itself. Every
capability lives here and is *called* from a thin demo cell: tool use, failure
recovery, planning, memory, reflection, the safety gate, multi-agent pipelines,
tracing, routing, and the full ``Sophia`` orchestrator that composes all of
them.

The design mirrors ``genai/thinking.py``: capability functions plus a little
demo data, so a chapter cell is usually one import and one call.

# ── A memory stream that reflects: recency x importance x relevance ───────────
# The generative-agents town {cite}`park2023generative` gives each character a
# memory stream: a long list of timestamped, natural-language observations. To
# decide what matters now, the agent scores every memory by a weighted blend of
# three things, RECENCY (an exponential decay since the memory was last touched),
# IMPORTANCE (the model rates each memory 1-10 the moment it is stored, mundane vs
# poignant), and RELEVANCE (embedding similarity to the situation at hand), and
# keeps the top few. Periodically it also REFLECTS: it distils its recent
# observations into a higher-level insight and stores that back into the stream, so
# what it recalls later can be a conclusion, not just a raw fact. This is a small,
# faithful version of all three, kept alongside the simpler ``Memory`` above rather
# than replacing it, since ``Sophia`` and the earlier demo still lean on that one.

# ── The season on one card: every audition's headline number, assembled ───────
# Pure assembly, no new measurements: each column reads the committed study
# constant its section already plotted, reduced to that section's own yardstick.
# Tool docs keeps the vague-label call rate (robustness to bad documentation),
# reflection keeps the gain over blind retry (the section crowned the most
# improved, not the highest scorer), and calibration keeps the confidence
# claimed on impossible questions, where lower is better. The reflexion and
# skill-reuse suites ran on a subset of the cast, so models that did not read
# for a part simply have no entry and the chart shows a dash.
